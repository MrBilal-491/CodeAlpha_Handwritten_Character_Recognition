# CodeAlpha_Handwritten_Character_Recognition
Handwriting varies greatly between individuals due to differences in writing styles, stroke thickness, slant, and pressure. This variability makes the problem challenging for traditional image processing methods. DL, specifically CNN, can automatically learn relevant features from raw pixel data without requiring manual feature engineering.
3. Dataset
We will use well-established datasets for handwritten character recognition:
1. MNIST Dataset
o Contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9).
o Image size: 28×28 pixels.
o 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.
o Widely used as a benchmark for digit recognition.
2. EMNIST Dataseto Extended MNIST that includes handwritten characters and letters.
o Multiple splits are available, such as:
▪ EMNIST ByClass: Digits + Letters
▪ EMNIST Letters: Only letters (A–Z)
o Image size: 28×28 pixels.
4. Approach
The problem will be solved using a deep learning pipeline consisting of the following steps:
4.1 Data Collection and Loading
• Load datasets from open repositories (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras datasets or EMNIST via
tensorflow_datasets or torchvision).
• The images are already labeled and standardized.
4.2 Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing ensures data is clean and suitable for training:
• Normalization: Scale pixel values from 0–255 to 0–1 to make training more stable.
• Reshaping: CNNs require images with explicit channel dimensions (e.g., 28×28×1 for
grayscale).
• One-Hot Encoding: Convert numeric class labels into binary vectors for classification.
5. Model Architecture – Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Why CNN?
CNNs are particularly well-suited for image-based tasks because they:
• Automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features (edges → shapes → objects).
• Preserve local spatial relationships through convolution filters.
Layers Overview
1. Convolutional Layers
o Apply filters to detect features like edges, curves, or textures.o Example: 32 filters of size 3×3, stride 1.
2. Activation Function
o Use ReLU to introduce non-linearity and speed up training.
3. Pooling Layers
o Typically Max Pooling to reduce spatial dimensions and computation while
retaining key features.
o Example: Pool size 2×2.
4. Flattening
o Convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector to feed into fully connected layers.
5. Fully Connected Layers (Dense Layers)
o Learn high-level representations from extracted features.
o Output layer uses Softmax activation for multi-class probability distribution.
6. Model Training
• Loss Function:
o categorical_crossentropy for multi-class classification.
• Optimizer:
o Adam is widely used for its adaptive learning rate.
• Metrics:
o Accuracy is the primary metric for classification.
• Epochs and Batch Size:
o Epochs: Usually 10–30 for MNIST.
o Batch size: 32 or 64 for efficient GPU utilization.
